This paper builds upon the growing critical scholarship examining the urban equity implications of the giant online sharing accommodation platform, Airbnb. It focuses on Airbnb listings in two major Australian metropolitan regions, Sydney and Melbourne. The paper raises important questions about the socio-economic patterns of Airbnb offering, and basically asks who is taking part in the sharing. It examines the Airbnb listings against the Census-based Socio-Economic Indexes for Area (SEIFA), and housing tenure data. Findings clearly show the biased distribution of Airbnb listings, presenting Airbnb hosting as a relatively affluent phenomena with education as the strongest socio-economic factor determining host participation on the platform. Nevertheless, areas in strategic tourist locations have been identified as places where Airbnb is having a pressing impact, and where imminent regulatory intervention is required.},

It looks at the strategies that have been enacted, both visible or overt and invisible or covert, opening up the tricky question of what counts (and what does not) as resistance to gentrification. In so doing it highlights the much less considered value of invisible practices of resistance: the non-politicised, covert, unintentional, informal, and deliberately invisible practices of everyday life that draw on different perceptions of time and survival, the negotiation of ambiguity and mobilization of invisibility. The chapter discusses what resistance is and what we might mean by resistance specifically in the field of gentrification studies. Is anti-gentrification resistance about the creation of alternatives or simply a series of oppositional, defensive practices? How can we evaluate if resistance has been successful? The chapter concludes that the visibility of resistance and counter collective knowledge production central in anti-gentrification practices might not be that useful after all in spaces where informality, ambiguity and invisibility have become some of the best strategies through which to resist the assault of displacement.},

Using 2001 census data for England and Scotland, this paper looks at the scale and composition of flows for deprived neighbourhoods with a particular focus on educational attainment. It analyses the impacts of these flows on the characteristics of deprived areas, exploring differences between regions and comparing neighbourhoods involved in two major regeneration programmes with other deprived areas. The paper shows that selective migration flows do serve to reinforce spatial segregation but that the scale of this effect appears very modest and that impacts vary between regions. Flows for the regeneration areas are less adverse than for similarly deprived neighbourhoods.},

In the second stage, referred to as spatial reclassification, the classified pixels are grouped into discrete land-use categories on the basis of both the frequency and the spatial arrangement of the land-cover labels within a square kernel. The application of this technique, known as SPARK ( \textasciitilde{} \textasciitilde{} \textasciitilde{} Rt eicalaslsification erne el), is demonstrated using a SPOT-1 HRV m ultispectral image of southeast London, England.

Social gradients in health are measured using deprivation indices, which are typically constructed from aggregated socio-economic data taken from the national census \textendash{} a technique which dates back at least until the early 1970's. The primary method of index construction over the last decade has been a Principal Component Analysis. Seldom are the indices constructed from survey-based data sources due to the inherent difficulty in validating the subjectivity of the response scores. We argue that this very subjectivity can uncover spatial distributions of local health outcomes. Moreover, indication of neighbourhood socio-economic status may go underrepresented when weighted without expert opinion. In this paper we propose the use of geographic information science (GIS) for constructing the index. We employ a GIS-based Order Weighted Average (OWA) Multicriteria Analysis (MCA) as a technique to validate deprivation indices that are constructed using more qualitative data sources. Both OWA and traditional MCA are well known and used methodologies in spatial analysis but have had little application in social epidemiology.},

The ability of agent-based models (ABMs) to represent heterogeneity in the characteristics and behaviors of actors enables analyses about the implications of this heterogeneity for system behavior. The importance of heterogeneity in the specification of ABMs, however, creates new demands for empirical support. An earlier analysis of a survey of residential preferences within southeastern Michigan revealed seven groups of residents with similar preferences on similar characteristics of location. In this paper, we present an ABM that represents the process of residential development within an urban system and run it for a hypothetical pattern of environmental variation. Residential locations are selected by residential agents, who evaluate locations on the basis of preference for nearness to urban services, including jobs, aesthetic quality of the landscape, and their similarity to their neighbors. We populate our ABM with a population of residential preferences drawn from the survey results in five different ways: (1) preferences drawn at random; (2) equal preferences based on the mean from the entire survey sample; (3) preferences drawn from a single distribution, whose mean and standard deviation are derived from the survey sample; (4) equal preferences within each of seven groups, based on the group means; and (5) preferences drawn from distributions for each of seven groups, defined by group means and standard deviations. Model sensitivity analysis, based on multiple runs of our model under each case, revealed that adding heterogeneity to agents has a significant effect on model outcomes, measured by aggregate patterns of development sprawl and clustering.},

At the core of urban redevelopment emerge policy instruments, including Land Value Capture (LVC), that smooth the way for desired project outcomes. This article explores three major urban redevelopment projects carried out by different coalitions of societal actors, often depicted as having irreconcilable interests and resources, in three Danish towns and cities\textemdash Aarhus, Aalborg and K\o ge. We suggest that a governmentality perspective, with its attentiveness to the rationalities and technologies activated in governmental projects, helps us to interrogate the ways in which the interests and resources of different actors are mobilised and reconciled for value creation in LVC based redevelopment. This paper argues that land value increment, central to LVC instruments, offers limited insight into accessing the success of, or `best practices' in, LVC based redevelopment. LVC instruments create fields of action where the interests and resources of state and non-state actors can coalesce around broader, and some competing, ideas of value. Examining the conditions in which value is created, captured and used in LVC based redevelopment further challenges stereotypical views that depict the logics and practices of state and non-state actors as essentially antagonistic.},

Specifically, we conduct the analysis at the minor civil division level in Wisconsin, USA, from 1970 to 2000. The results suggest that the factors have varying effects on population change over time and across rural, suburban, and urban areas. Their effects depend upon the general trend of population redistribution processes, local dynamics, and areal characteristics. Overall, a systematic examination of population change should consider a variety of factors, temporal and spatial variation of their effects, and spatial spillover effects. The examination should have the flexibility to identify and incorporate influential factors at a given point in time and space, not to adhere to a single set of drivers in all circumstances. The findings have important implications for population predictions used for local and regional planning.},

The concept of the photon mean optical path length and the implications for use in modeling reflectance spectra are presented. It is shown that the mean optical path length in a particulate surface is in rough inverse proportion to the square root of the absorption coefficient. Thus, the stronger absorber a material is, the less photons will penetrate into the surface. The concept of apparent absorbance (-In reflectance) is presented, and it is shown that absorption bands, which are Gaussian in shape when plotted as absorption coefficient (true absorbance) versus photon energy, are also Gaussians in apparent absorbance. However, the Gaussians in apparent absorbance have a smaller intensity and a width which is a factor of {$\surd$}2 larger. An apparent continuum in a reflectance spectrum is modeled as a mathematical function used to isolate a particular absorption feature for analysis. It is shown that a continuum should be removed by dividing it into the reflectance spectrum or subtracting it from the apparent absorbance and that the fitting of Gaussians to absorption features should be done using apparent absorbance versus photon energy. Kubelka-Munk theory is only valid for materials with small total absorption and for bihemispherical reflectance, which are rarely encountered in geologic remote sensing. It is shown that the recently advocated bidirectional reflectance theories have the potential for use in deriving mineral abundance from a reflectance spectrum.},

Because the issues of racial composition are socially sensitive, additional tests examined the relationship of preferences to behavior. Although many behaviors generally follow expressed preferences, members of households who expressed ``no preference'' also were found to largely choose own race neighborhoods.

Whites' unwillingness to move to African-American neighborhoods of more than 50\% other race exacerbates the tendency to separate. Socioeconomic status plays a similar role for other ethnic groups.

  abstract = {Cities are central to the economic and social development of European society, not only because over 80\% of European citizens live in urban areas, but also because cities are at the same time centres of production, innovation, employment, and culture, and loci of segregation, deprivation, and ethnic conflict. The emergence of a European-wide urban policy, has given new impetus to the need for comparable indicators of the quality of life to monitor development and policy implementation. This paper reviews the literature on quality of life indicators, and argues that traditional measures of the quality of life need to be supplemented with two new dimensions that reflect more recent postmodernist thinking about the composition of urban landscapes, and the contribution to the quality of life of the emerging information society. We argue that the challenges of building appropriate indicators reflecting these new dimensions are considerable, even in urban environments so rich in information systems and data sources, if they are to qualify as ?digital cities?. There are difficulties in finding common workable definitions of the indicators themselves, as well as definitions of the relevant populations, including city residents, and users. By raising these issues and suggesting possible avenues for addressing these challenges we contribute to a much-needed debate on how to define such indicators, which is the prerequisite for their development and use.},

Yet social and mobile datasets have limitations that, if not sufficiently understood and accounted for, can produce specific kinds of analytical and ethical oversights. In this paper, we analyze some of the problems that emerge from the reliance on particular forms of crisis data, and we suggest ways forward through a deeper engagement with ethical frameworks and a more critical questioning of what crisis data actually represents. In particular, the use of Twitter data and crowdsourced text messages during crisis events such as Hurricane Sandy and the Haiti Earthquake raised questions about the ways in which crisis data act as a system of knowledge. We analyze these events from ontological, epistemological, and ethical perspectives and assess the challenges of data collection, analysis and deployment. While privacy concerns are often dismissed when data is scraped from public-facing platforms such as Twitter, we suggest that the kinds of personal information shared during a crisis\textemdash often as a way to find assistance and support\textemdash present ongoing risks. We argue for a deeper integration of critical data studies into crisis research, and for researchers to acknowledge their role in shaping norms of privacy and consent in data use.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the so-called sharing economy has spread all over the world and, through the proliferation of online peer-to-peer platforms, provides a marketplace that matches sellers who want to sell/share their underutilised assets with buyers who need them. One of the well-known and heavily debated manifestations of the sharing economyis an accommodation provider platform called Airbnb. Airbnb is experiencing astonishing growth provoking several intense debates, regulatory challenges, and political battles due to its wide-spread effects on rental and real-estate markets. Thus, it is important to analyse the uneven spatial effects of the phenomenon. This paper aims to map Airbnb's presence in New York City but, going beyond visual inspection, it analyses the socio-economic factors influencing the spatiality of Airbnb in the American metropolis. After collecting data from various data sources, we performed a statistical analysis (correlation, regression analysis) to determine the socio-economic conditions of areas and revealed those factors that may affect the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings in the city. Results highlight that (1) Airbnb supply concentrates in those parts of New York City with a young population, (2) there is a significant number of housing units, and (3) the number of points of interest is high.},

The literature on GIScience education has emphasized content more than pedagogies \textendash{} what to teach versus how to teach to move students toward particular learning objectives. This emphasis is reflected in dominant curricular approaches to critical GIS, in which questions around the complicated origins and complicit social, political, and economic relationships of GIS are taken up as discrete topics, tacked onto instruction that otherwise prioritizes technical dimensions of GIScience. We argue that GIScience coursework must resist such modularization by approaching critical GIS not as a set of topics, but an orientation to GIS praxis that `does' GIS from within a questioning stance, to ask how we know. We outline specific curricular shifts and teaching practices we have used to foster this orientation in GIS students, offering ways of continually engaging students in practicing this orientation as they learn strong technical GIScience content. Finally, we trace the successes, challenges, and tensions sparked by these critical GIS pedagogies, drawing on student evaluation comments from our courses and reflecting on broader implications for GIScience instructors and geography faculty.},

This task can be accomplished through two strategic action plans. In the first instance, there is the need for the development of an entrepreneurial university and/or enhancing academic capabilities, by drawing in persons from industry and government. Second, there is the need to encourage the circulation of elites among university\textendash industry\textendash government in less developed countries characterised by strong, but largely inefficient governments, the relative low industrial capacity and weak academic sectors dominated by government. The triple helix model is applicable, in principle, in countries and regions experiencing other deficits.},

One essential component of healthy city design is improving neighborhood conditions in previously disinvested areas. To ensure equitable city design, policy makers, city planners, health practitioners, and researchers are interested in understanding the complex relationship between urban change, gentrification, and population health. Yet, the causal link between gentrification and health outcomes remain unclear. Without clear and consistent gentrification measures, researchers struggle to identify populations who are exposed to gentrification, and to compare health outcomes between exposed and unexposed populations. To move the science forward, this paper summarizes the challenges related to gentrification measurement in the United States and Canada when aspiring to conduct studies to analyze causal relationships between gentrification and health.

Although persons wishing to live near large cities were found to be looking for the same qualities of living sought by those who prefer a more remote location, these findings are not, in general, consistent with the argument that public preferences support strategies of population dispersal into nonmetropolitan areas. Instead they indicate that most of those who wish to live in a different location favor the peripheral metropolitan ring areas that have, in fact, been growing rapidly by in-migration.},

The aerosol information is extracted back to the visible based on aerosol models during the retrieval of water-leaving radiances.

  abstract = {Closing mobility and accessibility gaps between public transit riders and private car users is key to tackling social exclusion and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, place-based potential accessibility methods do not accurately measure real gaps in the uptake of activity opportunities because people usually have limited activity spaces. This study introduces people-based activity space approaches to measure activity disparities between the two modal groups. To overcome difficulties in obtaining large-scale individual activity data, this study used vehicle plate recognition data and public transit smart card data to anonymously identify activities. Individual activity spaces were characterised by six primary activity features from different dimensions. The analysis confirmed that, relative to transit riders, people who use cars on average accessed more activities within a larger activity space and enjoyed overall higher travel efficiency. A comprehensive indicator was further derived from the primary activity features to quantify activity disparities at the zone level. Zones with the highest risk of social exclusion were observed in the outskirts. In contrast, the city centre and inner suburbs exhibited significant equality of the two transport modes in fulfilling mobility needs for engagement in activities. Activity disparities between the two modalities were determined per area in specific activity dimensions, namely activity extensity, activity diversity, and travel efficiency. Finally, statistical models provided evidence that public transport facilities (especially rail transit) and location factors (distance to the city centre) are essential in determining modality-associated gaps in access to urban activity opportunities. Socioeconomic status and land use diversity also partially contributed to the inequality in specific dimensions of the activity space. This people-centred approach is critical for tackling transport inequality and achieving SDGs while ``leaving no one behind''.},

  abstract = {The incidence of mental health disorders in urban areas is increasing and there is a growing interest in using urban blue spaces (urban waterways, canals, lakes, ponds, coasts, etc.) as a tool to manage and mitigate mental health inequalities in the population. However, there is a dearth of longitudinal evidence of the mechanisms and impact of blue spaces on clinical markers of mental health to support and inform such interventions. We conducted a 10-year retrospective study, following STROBE guidelines, using routinely collected population primary care health data within the National Health Service (NHS) administrative area of Greater Glasgow and Clyde for the North of Glasgow city area. We explored whether living near blue space modifies the negative effect of socio-economic deprivation on mental health during the regeneration of an urban blue space (canal) from complete dereliction and closure. A total of 132,788 people (65,351 female) fulfilling the inclusion criteria were entered in the analysis. We established a base model estimating the effect of deprivation on the risk of mental health disorders using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age, sex and pre-existing comorbidities. We then investigated the modifying effect of living near blue space by computing a second model which included distance to blue space as an additional predicting variable and compared the results to the base model. Living near blue space modified the risk of mental health disorders deriving from socio-economic deprivation by 6\% (hazard ratio 2.48, 95\% confidence interval 2.39\textendash 2.57) for those living in the most deprived tertile (T1) and by 4\% (hazard ratio 1.66, 95\% confidence interval 1.60\textendash 1.72) for those in the medium deprivation tertile (T2). Our findings support the notion that living near blue space could play an important role in reducing the burden of mental health inequalities in urban populations.},

Less is known about the relative role of objective and subjective reports of neighbourhood conditions, how their effect on health changes as people age, and whether they moderate each other's impact on health. This study uses the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) to determine whether older adults report worse self-rated health as they age, and whether this differs between objective and subjective measures of neighbourhood. ELSA data contain 53,988 person-years across six waves collected biannually between 2002 and 03 and 2012~and 13. Objective neighbourhood conditions are measured by the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation, and subjective neighbourhood conditions are captured by a summative neighbourhood dissatisfaction score. We find both objective and subjective neighbourhood composite scores independently predict poor health. There is no change over time in the probability of reporting poor health by baseline objective or subjective neighbourhood scores, suggesting neighbourhood effects do not compound as older adults age. There is no moderating effect of area dissatisfaction on the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and health. The findings provide little support for causal neighbourhood effects operating in later life and indicate different causal pathways through which objective and subjective neighbourhood deprivation impact on health.},

This paper asks whether the ``Coase theorem'' for addressing the problem of externalities might provide insights for addressing such challenges in addition to, or instead of, traditional forms of planning control. Focusing specifically on the manifestation of Airbnb as the largest global platform for online home-sharing, the paper identifies the range of externalities and impacts associated with different home-sharing practices under different neighbourhood and housing market contexts. It then examines the potential utility of the Coase theorem which argues that well defined property rights provide a basis for private arbitration and compensation over externalities, without the need for government intervention, to help resolve impacts arising from Airbnb style home-sharing. In particular, the paper examines whether the low transaction cost enabled by online platforms, may support new forms of bargaining and compensation as alternatives to traditional planning regulation and control, and the extent to which arbitrated solutions could address the spectrum of externalities associated with Airbnb and similar platforms. Data sources include public submissions to a 2015 government inquiry on the regulation of short term holiday accommodation (in the state of NSW, Australia), as well as a comparative analysis of the geography and scale of Airbnb listings in two distinct metropolitan and regional areas of the state (Greater Sydney and the Northern Rivers region of coastal NSW). The paper concludes that a Coasian approach might inspire more pragmatic alternatives to traditional forms of urban regulation and control but fails to address the wider spatial policy and housing market concerns associated with Airbnb style holiday rentals.},

Spectral reflectances are available for each pixel of an image, but ground reference population data are available only for larger zones. The general response has been to build models for the average population density of the zones, utilizing spatially aggregated spectral data. This approach has limitations, both for the modelingprocess andfor the utilization of the resulting spatially aggregated population estimates. A pixel-based alternative is described. Pixels of a Landsat TM image were classified as residential or non-residential using standard techniques. Initial reference populations were assigned by uniformly distributing the population of each zone across its residential pixels. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was used to iteratively regress pixel population on spectral indicators and re-estimate pixel populations. Predictive validity was tested by applying the fitted regression equation to a second image. The pixel-based model produced population estimates of comparable accuracy to those resulting from a much more complex zone-based modeling procedure. The pixel-based procedure was also more robust and more amenable to refinement, particularly at the extremes of population density The relative error in the estimated total urban population of both primary and secondary study areas was less than 2 percent. Median relative error in the population of individual zones was 26 percent in the primary study area (24 percent for urban zones) and 21 percent in the secondary study area (17 percent for urban zones).},

Accordingly, the emphasis of urban policy has shifted from fighting the ?blight? to eliminating the ?obsolescence?, which signifies the rise of neoliberal urban policies. The first wave of gentrification started in the late 1980s and paused in 1999 and was mainly in the form of sporadic housing redevelopment justified by city betterment and infrastructure improvement. The second wave surged around 2005, featuring an ambitious urban upgrading scheme with the aim of building a world-class city. While the first wave of gentrification was a modest experiment of marketised operation, the second wave of gentrification is at the core of the local government's growth-seeking and city reimaging neoliberal urban strategy. Defending the right to appropriation has been a major struggle for residents affected in both waves of gentrification, although in the first wave there was very little room left for rights claiming. In the second wave, rights conflicts have gone deeper and been more fierce, and struggles for a right to participation started to rise. Buttressed by local media, academics, activists, and volunteers, local residents have made modest progress in defending their rights. Yet, it is still far from seriously challenging the power structure in urban decision-making and the trajectory of (re)urbanisation dominated by the elite class and vested interest groups.},

  abstract = {Estimating urban green volume is getting more and more important within the frame of an ecologically orientated city planning and environmentally sustainable development. The first and the last pulse of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data provide the basis for the estimation of green volume, but these optimal data are not always available, particularly for urban areas. That is why this paper deals with the question whether LiDAR data (last pulse only) that have not been taken during the vegetation period allow a sufficient estimation of the green volume. This paper sets up on previous results where LiDAR data have been compared to photogrammetrically determined vegetation height measurements. The subtraction of the laser-based Digital Terrain Model and Digital Surface Model in vegetated areas leads to a vast underestimation of green volume of up to 85\%, which is mainly due to the standing deciduous trees with an underestimation of 90\%. Starting from the existence of different laser response characteristics of various vegetation types, the relative point density and the normalized height of classified nonground points were analyzed in depth. The results show a good separation of different vegetation types. Furthermore, a pragmatic approach of reconstruction of the underestimated vegetation (mainly deciduous trees) is carried out by generating cylinders for the classified nonground points to compensate the volume loss. The point density of nonground points and the normalized height of the laser responses were used to regulate the adaptive cylinder construction based on fuzzy logic techniques. Using reference data, the accuracy could be estimated. In spite of the suboptimal LiDAR data, this paper leads to a sufficiently exact and efficient estimation of green volume compared to the costly conventional methods like field investigations. The method makes a contribution in the field of data improvement and is applicable to similar LiDAR data of other areas.},

These debates focus primarily on structural processes. However, we have comparatively little insight into how and to what degree different mechanisms actually underpin upgrading in urban neighbourhoods. This paper uses Dutch register data to show how residential mobility, social mobility, and demographic change each contribute to gentrification in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. First, our findings show that residential mobility remains key to understanding the growth of higher-income residents in gentrifiying neighbourhoods. At the same time, social mobility and demographic change? notably ageing?are most important in explaining dwindling numbers of lower-income residents. Second, large differences exist across neighbourhoods. By mapping three idealtypical drivers of gentrification, we show how the migration-based ?displacement model? occurs predominantly in upgrading neighbourhoods with a high status. Conversely, in low-status upgrading neighbourhoods social mobility is more important in explaining gentrification. These different forms of upgrading occur simultaneously in both cities and should be integrated to advance our understanding of gentrification as a process that is both widespread and occurs in different, ever-changing forms across neighbourhoods.},

LVC encompasses a wide range of mechanisms, applied in very diverse contexts to monetize `windfall' gains, accruing to landowners because of growth, infrastructure or place-making projects. Despite widespread conviction that a proportion of these `unearned increments' should somehow be harvested for the wider public good, contention, legal and pragmatic challenges remain.  As policy makers confront population pressures, transport needs and inequality, LVC can help bridge infrastructure funding gaps, accelerate housing provision and temper polarization.   Betterment taxes, Tax Increment Finance (TIF) or participatory instruments like land readjustment can target `planning gains' capitalized into land and property values near stations, historic monuments or upgraded precincts.  As well as flagging instrument diversity and variable contexts, the literature suggests LVC mechanisms work best in a joined-up policy context. Ironically, spatial LVC schemes like TIF are most likely to fail when the regeneration need is most acute. In America, inadequate governance, scrutiny or auditing undermined schemes to fund transport or improve the public realm.  In Europe LVC exists in a variety of modalities but three European examples, suggests it remains underutilized.   London megaprojects, UK regional housing schemes and French sprawl, illustrate that policy makers have yet to adequately capture unearned increments.},

Such systems along with spatial analysis techniques like digital image processing and geographical information system (GIS) can be used for the monitoring and planning purposes as these enable the reporting of overall sprawl at a detailed level. In the present work, urban sprawl of the Ajmer city (situated in Rajasthan State of India) has been studied at a mid scale level, over a period of 25 years (1977\textendash 2002), to extract the information related to sprawl, area of impervious surfaces and their spatial and temporal variability. Statistical classification approaches have been used for the classification of the remotely sensed images obtained from various sensors viz. Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ and IRS LISS-III. Urban sprawl and its spatial and temporal characteristics have been derived from the classified satellite images. The Shannon's entropy and landscape metrics (patchiness and map density) have been computed in terms of spatial phenomenon, in order to quantify the urban form (impervious area). Further, multivariate statistical techniques have been used to establish the relationship between the urban sprawl and its causative factors. Results reveal that land development (160.8\%) in Ajmer is more than three times the population growth (50.1\%). Shannon's entropy and landscape metrics has revealed the spatial distribution of the urban sprawl over a period of last 25 years.},

We provide a critical and comprehensive review of the characteristics of remote sensing systems, and in particular the trade-offs between various system parameters, as well as their use in two key research areas: (a) issues resulting from the expansion of urban environments, and (b) sustainable urban development. The analysis identifies three key trends in the existing literature: (a) the integration of heterogeneous remote sensing data, primarily for investigating or modelling urban environments as a complex system, (b) the development of new algorithms for effective extraction of urban features, and (c) the improvement in the accuracy of traditional spectral-based classification algorithms for addressing the spectral heterogeneity within urban areas. Growing interests in renewable energy have also resulted in the increased use of remote sensing\textemdash for planning, operation, and maintenance of energy infrastructures, in particular the ones with spatial variability, such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy.

The rapid, unplanned transformation of urban LULC significantly affects the functions of the associated ecosystem and biodiversity. This study aims to identify the variation in LULC, and its influences on the urban thermal environment, such as LST, urban heat island (UHI), and urban field variance index (UTFVI), for Chattogram city, Bangladesh. Multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper/OLI: Operational Land Imager (TM/OLI) satellite images were used for the years 1999, 2009, and 2019, to classify LULC classes, identify the transition between different LULCs and to quantify variation in LST, UHI and UFVI distribution in the study area. Using the support vector machine algorithm, the LULC was classified, and the accuracy of the categorized maps was more than 85\%. The spectral radiance model was used to extract urban thermal information from satellite images. The analysis of LULC estimation suggests a significant net increase in urban built-up areas (+3.51\%) and a reduction in vegetation cover (-6.81\%). The mean LST distribution shows that the high-temperature zones were associated with built-up areas, with the lowest temperatures being associated with vegetated cover and water bodies. The UHI and UTFVI estimation also indicate a trend toward increased surface heat stress in the study area. The study demonstrates that a rise in the non-evaporative surfaces (built-up area) and a reduction in the green cover has significantly increased the LST, UHI and UTFVI effects in the study area. Remote-sensing techniques were found to be very useful, particularly in minimizing the time required to evaluate urban expansion and to assess the influence of urbanization on LST.},

A number of ground truthing areas were used to classify the resulting datasets and to identify lacunarity ranges which are typical for settlement types that combine high density housing and small dwelling size \textendash{} features characteristic for urban slums in India. It was discovered that the line detection algorithm is advantageous over principal component analysis in providing suitable binary datasets for lacunarity analysis as it is less sensitive to spectral variability within mosaicked imagery. The resulting slum location map constitutes an efficient tool in identifying particularly overcrowded areas of the city and can be used as a reliable source in vulnerability and resilience assessments at a later stage.

  abstract = {The survey-based slum mapping (SBSM) program conducted by the Indonesian government to reach the national target of ``cities without slums'' by 2019 shows mapping inconsistencies due to several reasons, e.g., the dependency on the surveyor's experiences and the complexity of the slum indicators set. By relying on such inconsistent maps, it will be difficult to monitor the national slum upgrading program's progress. Remote sensing imagery combined with machine learning algorithms could support the reduction of these inconsistencies. This study evaluates the performance of two machine learning algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), for slum mapping in support of the slum mapping campaign in Bandung, Indonesia. Recognizing the complexity in differentiating slum and formal areas in Indonesia, the study used a combination of spectral, contextual, and morphological features. In addition, sequential feature selection (SFS) combined with the Hilbert\textendash Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) was used to select significant features for classifying slums. Overall, the highest accuracy (88.5\%) was achieved by the SVM with SFS using contextual, morphological, and spectral features, which is higher than the estimated accuracy of the SBSM. To evaluate the potential of machine learning-based slum mapping (MLBSM) in support of slum upgrading programs, interviews were conducted with several local and national stakeholders. Results show that local acceptance for a remote sensing-based slum mapping approach varies among stakeholder groups. Therefore, a locally adapted framework is required to combine ground surveys with robust and consistent machine learning methods, for being able to deal with big data, and to allow the rapid extraction of consistent information on the dynamics of slums at a large scale.},

These dynamic spaces can best be understood as spaces of ubiquitous information and communication technologies (ICT) where knowledge is key to regional innovation systems, creating the notion of ``smart cities.''},

Socio-economic variables, including population density, income, poverty, employment rate, education level and house characteristics from US census 2000, were integrated with the environmental variables at the block group level to derive indicators of quality of life. Pearson's correlation was computed to analyse the relationships among the variables. Further, factor analysis was conducted to extract unique information from the combined dataset. Three factors were identified and interpreted as material welfare, environmental conditions and crowdedness respectively. Each factor was viewed as a unique aspect of the quality of life. A synthetic index of the urban quality of life was created and mapped based on weighted factor scores of the three factors. Finally, regression models were built to estimate the quality of life in the city of Indianapolis based on selected environmental and socioeconomic variables.},

  abstract = {With the rural-to-urban migration under China's rapid urbanization, the Bohai Rim of China experienced dramatic rural housing land transition (RHLT) in the last decade, especially in terms of per capita rural housing land (PRHL). The objectives of this study are to (i) analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of RHLT, and (ii) detect the underlying driving forces and mechanism of RHLT in Bohai Rim during 2000\textendash 2010. To achieve these goals, we collected and rasterized high resolution Landsat TM data, socio-economic and physical environmental data for the Bohai Rim. Spatial econometric regression models at both grid scale and county scale were developed to examine the driving forces of RHLT in Bohai Rim. The results indicated that the distribution of rural housing land was characterized by vertical zonality, i.e., the proportion of rural housing land decreased gradually with the increase of elevation, and was more sensitive to slope than to elevation. The results of hot spots analysis showed that the spatial mismatch of rural housing land change and rural population migration made the regional differences of RHLT more remarkable, based on which four rural housing land consolidation regional types were differentiated. The authors argue that towns are effective hubs for linking the urban system and rural system, and it is better to get the farmers to migrate to towns instead of big cities in the process of pushing forward China's new-type urbanization in the future. For this, it is necessary to further improve related system and institution. Only by this way can the relationship between out-migrated farmers and rural housing land be orderly and completely removed, so as to smoothly pushing forward rural housing land consolidation.},

However, some scholars believe the declining rate of American internal migration seems to have `slowed down' obviously from 2007. This debate prompts us to quantitatively analyze the possible changes in migration patterns and the mechanisms of domestic population mobility. First, using empirical data of state-to-state migration, the paper quantifies American internal mobility and the evolution of migration patterns for the period from 2005\textendash 2015. Regional income disparities cannot explain the change in population migration patterns in the United States well. Then, the mobility barriers are estimated by an extended multilateral migration model that reveals a marked decrease in regional migration costs and an increase in individual rational choices, which are the critical factors in the structural changes in the migration pattern. Subsequently, we deconstruct the mobility barriers and indicate that in recent years, the human and natural environments had a great impact on population movement in the United States, such as the human development index, education grade, climate, cost of living index, house price index, and crime rate.},

The geographical spread of tourism gentrification from Western countries to emerging countries like China inevitably challenges existing explanations. Using the case of the Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town (OCT) community in China, this study examines the causes and socio-spatial consequences of tourism gentrification with the aim of widening the discussion on tourism gentrification. Historically, the Shenzhen OCT community was a traditional farm with single group of peasants. Over the past two decades, it has become a mixed gentrified community with upper-class and low-income residents. Theme parks and other tourist facilities now dominate much of the community. This empirical analysis of this community highlights some of the features of tourism gentrification in China. It can be a type of new-build gentrification evolving from a brownfield area. The emergence of a rent gap is the result of rapid urbanization in China but not of suburbanization. The government gives the primary land developers some community administration rights to promote tourism and community development. Tourism gentrification leads to a mixed community with a certain proportion of low-income residents, which generates a diversity of cultural preferences and consumption patterns in the OCT community. In the changing context of China and other emerging countries, tourism gentrification is one part of a broader transformation of social space from lower-class to upper-class spaces. In this case, tourism becomes the main driving force in economic, social, cultural, and lifestyle transformations.},

The great potential of GEE to support ecological and urban modeling is less explored. In this study, we augmented GEE functions with a few sets of user-customized functions for improving image classification accuracy, estimating ecosystem services, and modeling urban growth sustainability. The paper is the first effort of modeling urban sustainability based on the concept of ecosystem service value (ESV) and in the cloud with GEE; is the first application of classifying GEE Landsat time-series images to compute yearly ESV; and creates the first set of cloud tools to augment GEE for ecologists and urban modelers to model urban sustainability from GEE and ESV. The paper also chose Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia as a case study to model urban sustainability in a time-series 12~years (2005\textendash 2016). The case study successfully estimated ecosystem service values and analyzed urban growth sustainability. It also revealed spatial disparities and temporal dynamics of urban growth sustainability in Hohhot City. The study provides an easy-to-adapt illustration on using GEE for image-based ecological and urban modeling.},

First, the total rural population decreased after 1995, and the size and rate of decrease follow an accelerating trend. Second, the rural population change has obvious spatial differences: some regions experience dramatic rural population decline, while others experience growth. Third, the spatial difference of rural population change is closely related to economic factors, including the per capita GDP, urbanization level, and noneconomic factors, including the rural population size and fertility level. According to our findings, we suggest that the government pay more attention to rural population change and its impacts and that narrowing the regional development gap may be the most effective way to promote sustainable development of rural areas in less developed regions.},

  abstract = {To the modernist and image building Chinese state, urban villages are unique but a transitional phenomenon of urbanization where peri-urban peasants have built substandard informal houses for low-income earners. Since the late 2000s, the Beijing government began forced redevelopment of urban villages at prime and strategically located sites. Potential of high value returns has enabled the municipal government to offer relatively high compensation rates, creating hence a new multimillion ``propertied'' class. While new estates have edged out low-income tenants, they have created ``gentrified'' resettlement communities with predominantly middle- to high-income high-tech tenants or owner-occupiers. Supported by site surveys, this paper examines this state-dominated property formalization and regularization process, and the ways in which informalities have been replaced by a sharp value uplift shared between local governments and local peasants. It is also noted that such replacement has created a new frontier of social inequalities where dislocated low-wage tenants have been eliminated and have to source affordable residence in more remote places. Policy implication of this paper is about how best to resettle them as equal citizens of the city.},

Taking 774 administrative villages in Laiyang County, which is in a hilly region, as our research area, we comprehensively used spatial analysis and geographic detectors to explore the spatial characteristics and driving factors of RPL, which was significantly correlated with rural planning. The research demonstrated that: (1) The rural population in Laiyang County generally had a low level of RPL (1.9\%), but each village varied greatly. The village with the greatest RPL had a rate of 56\%. The RPL between urban and rural areas, towns and streets, and villages and villages were unbalanced, and rural population flow mainly occurred between urban and rural areas. (2) RPL in Laiyang County was generally low in the central urban area and high in the northern and southern areas. Population loss presents agglomeration globally and high\textendash low agglomeration locally. (3) The distance from village to county, elevation, cultivated land quantity, collective economic income, village area, and ecological service value were the key factors influencing RPL in Laiyang County. When comparing the dominant factors, the interaction between collective income and elevation was the strongest. Exploring the spatial characteristics and influencing factors of RPL provided us with ideas for the classified promotion of rural revitalization, preparation of rural development planning, and promotion of the integrated development of urban and rural areas.},

The satellite image data were used to extract environmental variables of land cover, vegetation index, and surface temperature, while socioeconomic variables were obtained from the census data. Using the social space conceptualization put forth by Chombart de Lauwe, quality of life as a collective attribute that adheres to groups of people was assessed with reference to the morphological and sociocultural environment. A principal components analysis and a raster geographic information system overlay of variables were found to be useful approaches that effectively integrated biophysical and socioeconomic data together to give an accurate assessment of quality of life within the study area. It is concluded that high resolution satellite image data are a useful complement to census data by giving the environmental perspective in urban analysis.},

The socioeconomic variables from the census data are (1) population density, (2) per capita income, (3) median home value, and (4) percentage of college graduates. NDVI, which shows strong negative correlation with ``per cent of urban use'' and ``surface temperatures,'' is in turn strongly correlated with per capita income, population density, and median home value. The environmental and socioeconomic variables are integrated by means of two approaches: (1) principal components analysis and (2) geographical-information-system overlay of ranked data layers. These two approaches constitute respectively an objective and a subjective assessment of the QOL of the study area. The results of these analyses indicate that satellite inwge data can contplentent census data in providing QOL assessment with an environmental perspective.},

The land classes were identified by Landsat 5-TM scenes taken in the same season in 1988 and 1994. The phenomena of land class changes were evaluated by adopting two remote sensing approaches, namely mapping and modelling, in a case study of the Bangkok Metropolitan area of Thailand. The quantitative results of changes, which were computed from a post-classification method, were used to analyse the pattern of changes in the urban land classes. The change-detection analysis indicated that 2\% of agricultural land was lost, and there was a 14\% increase in the commercial areas. The results demonstrated that the pattern of change in the urban land classes in Bangkok was that of agriculture lands to open lands; open lands to residential, and residential to commercial. The highest commercial land growth was observed in the high-density residential areas along main roads and the railway line. Data were generated from the two dates of TM images for the vegetationimpervious-soil (V-I-S) composition model. The trends of changes in the urban land classes and the anatomy of the study area were presented quantitatively through the V-I-S model. Good agreement was obtained between the values of changes computed for the impervious surfaces from the V-I-S model (which showed 6\% changes) and the change-detection map (which showed 5.6\% changes). The results of changes in the spatial pattern of commercial and residential areas (high, medium and low) emphasize that remote sensing data can be used for V-I-S modelling and mapping of urban surface features.},

To adequately detect and map them, data is needed on their location, spatial extent and evolution. High- and very high-resolution remote sensing imagery has emerged as an important source of data in this regard. The purpose of this paper is to critically review studies that have used such data to detect and map slums. Our analysis shows that while such studies have been increasing over time, they tend to be concentrated to a few geographical areas and often focus on the use of a single approach (e.g., image texture and object-based image analysis), thus limiting generalizability to understand slums, their population, and evolution within the global context. We argue that to develop a more comprehensive framework that can be used to detect and map slums, other emerging sourcing of geospatial data should be considered (e.g., volunteer geographic information) in conjunction with growing trends and advancements in technology (e.g., geosensor networks). Through such data integration and analysis we can then create a benchmark for determining the most suitable methods for mapping slums in a given locality, thus fostering the creation of new approaches to address this challenge.},

Investments in transport thus need to seek new paradigms to solve these problems. Accessibility is a pivotal element in this context because it may induce increases in land value whereby some or all of these increments in land value resultant from the increase in accessibility can be captured to recover the capital costs of a transport investment. From this perspective the present paper reviews the main land value capture finance (LVC) mechanisms (betterment tax, accessibility increment contribution, and joint development) in relation to increased transport accessibility. The three financing instruments retain common features such as the ability to achieve wider public goals and private objectives, and they are flexible and can be implemented through different forms of financial instruments. We conclude that, for the successful implementation of a land value capture finance programme to take place, we must always consider the context (the urban area and the transport mode) in addition to the economic relationship between the life cycle of the transport system, its profitability and the property market.},

Management of the urban environment must consider phenomena at three scales, including the physical environment within cities, environmental systems consisting of cities and their regional hinterlands, and the environmental implications of the global network of megacities. Increasing availability of remotely sensed observations and a variety of other geospatial information could facilitate the development of new tools and approaches for understanding the urban environment. These new applications should take advantage of the special characteristics of remotely sensed data, including their broad spatial coverage, their capacity for routine and unobtrusive updating and their ability to provide self-consistent measurements of critical physical properties that would be difficult or expensive to obtain in situ. In many cases, using remote sensing data to measure and monitor urban environmental conditions will be more straightforward than using them for urban planning purposes, where traditional sources of governmental and private sector data are more easily obtained and understood. In developing countries, however, remote sensing may provide fundamental observations of urban growth and environmental conditions that are not available from other sources.},

This evidence though is based largely upon data that ignores long term exposures to neighbourhood contexts and is confounded by neighbourhood selection bias. In this study, we investigate the temporal ordering of exposure to neighbourhood deprivation throughout childhood and whether associations between neighbourhood deprivation and cigarette smoking are due to compositional or contextual neighbourhood effects. Data come from a UK cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We use longitudinal measures of neighbourhood deprivation and self-reported smoking behaviour for 2744 children to examine the influence of neighbourhood deprivation on smoking status and smoking heaviness at age 17. Our results demonstrate that children who are born into and grow up in deprived neighbourhoods are up to twice as likely to be smokers at age 17 than those in non-deprived neighbourhoods. These associations are largely due to family socioeconomic position and the intergenerational transmission of smoking behaviour from parents to children; compositional rather than direct contextual `neighbourhood effects'. Our findings highlight the importance of considering longitudinal exposure to neighbourhood deprivation over cross sectional exposure. In conclusion, we find that it is the family rather than the neighbourhood into which a child is born that determines their smoking behaviour.},

To overcome this difficulty, we propose a useful combination of spatial interaction modelling and microsimulation approaches for the reliable estimation of retail interactions based on a sample survey of consumer behaviour being linked with other areal statistics. We demonstrate this approach by building an operational retail interaction model to estimate expenditure flows from households to retail stores in a local city in Japan, Kusatsu City.},

Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information. RS data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods. Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme has been applications-driven and national development has been its prime motivation. From Bhaskara to Cartosat, India's EO capability has increased manifold. Improvements are not only in spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions, but also in their coverage and value-added products. Some of the major operational application themes, in which India has extensively used remote sensing data are agriculture, forestry, water resources, land use, urban sprawl, geology, environment, coastal zone, marine resources, snow and glacier, disaster monitoring and mitigation, infrastructure development, etc. The paper reviews RS techniques and applications carried out using both optical and microwave sensors.

Methods: The index is based on the smallest area unit used in Canadian censuses, with 400 to 700 persons on average. It includes six socio-economic indicators grouped along two dimensions - material and social - produced from principal component analyses. The index exists for 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 and in different versions, from local areas to the whole of Canada. Numerous products related to the index are available online free of charge. Results: The index has been used extensively in the field of health and social services, mainly in the province of Qu\'ebec but also elsewhere in Canada. It has had four main uses, all related to public health: describing geographic variations of deprivation, illustrating inequalities in population health status and in service use according to deprivation, supporting the development of health reports and policies, and guiding regional resource allocation. These applications are facilitated by a close partnership between the producers and users of the index. Conclusion: The deprivation index is a marker of social inequalities in health. It allows for monitoring of inequalities over time and space, and constitutes a useful tool for public health planning, intervention and service delivery.},

One of these activities, and one with the largest economical impact in a city, is retail dynamics and its evolution. Therefore, the mathematical modeling of the location of retail activities and of the emergence of clustering in retail centers has as well generated a large number of works. Despite these two interwoven components strongly depending on one another and their fundamental importance in understanding cities, little work has been done in order to compare their local and global properties. Here we compare the road network's hierarchical structure, unveiled through a percolation analysis of the network, with the retail location distribution defined by exploiting a gravity-based retail model. We interpret the great agreement in the city's organizations as it emerges from both methodologies as new evidence of the interdependence of these two crucial dimensions of a city's life.},

The representation of both the ground surface and the features on that surface necessitates the removal of these surface features if a ground surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) product is to be produced. This paper examines methods for extracting surface features from a Digital Surface Model (DSM) produced by LiDAR. It is argued that for some applications the extracted surface feature layer can be of almost equal importance to the DEM. The example of flood inundation modelling is used to illustrate how a DEM and a surface roughness layer could be extracted from the original DSM. The potential for refining surface roughness estimates by classifying extracted surface features using both topographic and spectral characteristics is considered using an Artificial Neural Network to discriminate between buildings and trees.},

  abstract = {This article presents a structural modeling analysis of the performance determinants of urban attractiveness, in terms of resident population and international tourism demand, in 40 global cities. The analysis focuses on the impacts of a diverse set of innovative drivers of urban value creation and sustainable solutions for city development (urban functions), which are collectively subsumed under the heading of `sustainable smart city'. Recognizing that the dynamics and growth processes related to these urban functions may have different impacts on different types of stakeholders, potentially leading to the emergence of serious conflicts between guests/visitors and residents, we aim to derive model-based implications for urban and tourism management in the cities concerned in order to move towards the sustainable future city as `a place 4 all'. The results of our latent growth curve model confirm the existence of different impacts of urban functions on visitors' and residents' attractiveness. Cultural dynamics appears to be a major determinant for attracting new residents and supporting a strong international tourism industry. From an economic perspective, purely economic strength (in terms of absolute growth) appears to enhance city attractiveness for residents, while the dynamics observed in research and development activities influences the quality of employment instead of being a direct driver of population growth. While the social aspects of sustainability (framed under the concept of livability) and the urban environment typically exert higher impacts on urban attractiveness, accessibility appears mostly relevant for visitors. Our analysis suggests an uneasy balance between livability, environment, and population and visitor volume and growth.},

Methods: NZDep has been created from four 5-yearly censuses using theory developed from international deprivation research, a standard statistical procedure (principal component analysis) and both construct and criterion validation. Results: The latest index was based on nine socio-economic deprivation variables available for just over 4 million people. It was calculated from a basis of 24,000 small areas containing a median of approximately 90 people. The deprivation index has a value from 1 (low) to 10 (high). It is mapped to standard administrative areas and is available free of charge. The index is easy to visualize, and deprivation maps are widely used. The index is used in many applications in research and social epidemiology, and routinely by the country's Ministry of Health, both to explore health variations across the country and to allocate central government funds to local health care providers. Geographers in local government were quick to recognize the index as a good tool for visualizing the diversity and neediness of local communities, and hence as a tool for town and service planning. Conclusion: The national NZDep index of small-area deprivation has been used widely in research on mortality, morbidity and determinants of ill health, and in needs assessment, resource allocation and advocacy.},

In some cases, multiple different terms are commonly used to describe the same fundamental approach, and it is not always clear when these terms are synonymous. Other terminology in common use is overly broad. When a single term may encompass instruments that operate in fundamentally different ways, important distinctions may be obscured. In the interest of clarifying the terminology used in imaging spectrometry, we present a comprehensive system for classification of imaging spectrometers based on two fundamental properties: the method by which they scan the object spatially, and the method by which they obtain spectral information.},

  abstract = {In the spirit of strengthening its intellectual foundations and clarifying its contributions to making sense of Earth, we should resist any inclination to treat geography as a club\textemdash a discipline with boundaries to be policed and defended. I advocate for the strengths of thinking geographically, a way of being in the world open to all. This means attending to the geography of knowledge production; how spatiotemporalities shape and are shaped by socionatural processes; the emergent more-than-human world; the variety of ontologies, epistemologies, and methodologies underlying knowledge claims; and the world not only as it is but also as it should be. Thinking geographically about globalizing capitalism can problematize the particular sociospatial positionalities from which commonsense understandings of capitalism have metastasized. Europe did not invent capitalist practices but became globalizing capitalism's center of calculation, catalyzed by the spatial dynamics of colonialism elevating Europe relative to its predecessors. Thinking geographically undermines the mainstream account of globalizing capitalism emanating from Europe, that of a rising tide capable of lifting all boats and bringing prosperity to all hard-working and responsible individuals and well-governed territories. Indeed, such body- and place-based accounts obscure how asymmetric connectivities between places and interscalar dynamics, coevolving with uneven geographical development, coproduce unequal sociospatial positionality and conditions of possibility for those propagating and encountering globalizing capitalism. Capitalism also cannot be understood, or practiced, simply as an economic process; its economic aspects are co-implicated with political, cultural (gendered, raced, etc.), social, and biophysical processes, in ways that repeatedly exceed and undermine any ``laws of economics.'' Thinking geographically necessitates acknowledging space for alternative, more-than-capitalist experiments and trajectories, enriched by peripheral experiences of and encounters with globalizing capitalism.},

Protecting YRB is crucial to China's rejuvenation and sustainable development of future generations. Coordinated development of human-land system is conducive to promoting ecological protection and high-quality development of YRB. Tapio decoupling model was used to study the relationship between rural residential land area and resident population. Our results showed that the rural resident population decreased by 2.57\% annually, while rural residential land areas expanded at a rate of 0.57\% from 2010 to 2016. In addition, the upper reaches had higher growth rate of residential land area than that in the middle and lower reaches. The strong negative decoupling relationship between rural residential land area and rural resident population was widely found in YRB. Kaya identity decomposition results indicated that rural residential land intensive utilization and urbanization of resident population was positively related to the expansion of rural residential land area, while the urban and rural population structure was responsible for rural residential land area shrinkage in YRB. Unfavorable rural development situation had extended from 2010 to 2016. These results suggested that the rural human-land relationship was uncoordinated in terms of the loss of rural resident population and expansion of rural residential land area in YRB. It is urgent to establish sustainable rural development strategies for improving the human-land relationship, narrowing the rural-urban disparity, innovating rural residential land area policies, and revitalizing the rural area.},

  abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has changed the world. We now depend on it for navigating vehicles, for route finding and we use it in our everyday lives to extract information about our locations and to track our movements. The latter use offers a potential alternative to more traditional sources of movement data through the construction of trip trajectories and, ultimately, the construction of origin-destination flow matrices. The advantage of being able to use GPS-derived movement data is that such data are potentially much richer than traditional sources of movement data both temporally and spatially. GPS-derived movement data potentially allow the calibration of spatial interaction models specific to very short time intervals, such as daily or even hourly, and for user-specified origins and destinations. Ultimately, it should be possible to calibrate continuously updated models in near real-time. However, the processing of GPS data into trajectories and then origin-destination flow matrices is not straightforward and is not well understood. This paper describes the process of transferring GPS tracking data into matrices that can be used to calibrate spatial interaction models. An example is given using retail behaviour in two towns in Scotland with an origin-constrained spatial interaction model calibrated for each day of the week and under different weather conditions (normal, rainy, windy). Although the study is small in terms of individuals and spatial context, it serves to demonstrate a future for spatial interaction modelling free from the tyranny of temporally static and spatially predefined data sets.},

Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health). We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1\% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim to address them.},

  abstract = {Promoting the coordinated development of population health and the economy is an important part of building a ``Healthy China'' and promoting high-quality economic development. Based on the systematic construction of the population health and economic development evaluation index system, this paper uses the coupled coordination model, geodetector, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to comprehensively measure the population health level and economic development level at the provincial scale in China in 2000 and 2015, and reveals the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of the coupled coordination relationship between the population health level and economic development level at the provincial scale in China from 2000 to 2015 and its driving factors. The results show the following: (1) China's population health and economic development are in a high-level coupling stage, and the coupling level increases slightly with time; spatially, two types of running-in coupling and high-level coupling coexist; the coupling degree in the eastern and central regions tends to increase, while the coupling degree in the western region tends to weaken. (2) China's population health and economic development are in a good coupling coordination stage as a whole, and the coupling coordination degree has an increasing trend; spatially, the coupling coordination degree shows high spatial differentiation characteristics in the east and low in the west; the good and high-quality coupling coordination type area tends to expand to the west, while the moderate coupling coordination type area tends to shrink to the west; there is also positive spatial agglomeration of coupling coordination degree, and the spatial agglomeration is gradually enhanced. (3) The coupling coordination of China's population health and economic development is driven by multiple factors such as natural conditions, health resources, culture quality, and urbanization level; the interaction between factors is stronger than that of a single factor, and the driving effect of each factor also shows significant spatial heterogeneity. This study is intended to provide a scientific basis for promoting harmonious population health and economic development.},

In general, spatial data on slums are generalized, outdated, or even nonexistent. The bird's eye view of remotely sensed data is capable to provide an independent, area-wide spatial overview, to capture the complex morphological pattern and at the same time capture the large-scale individual objects typical for slums. Using high-resolution optical satellite data, parameters such as building density, building heights, and sizes are used to differentiate between slums and formal settlements. From it, the physical features are used to analyze structural homogeneity and heterogeneities within and across slums and to suggest characteristic physical features for spatial slum delineation at three study sites in Mumbai, India.},

These slums evoke a more or less stereotype impression of built environments: complex, high dense alignments of small makeshift or run-down shelters. However, this perceived characteristic morphology is neither globally homogeneous nor is this perception covering morphologic appearances of urban poverty in a comprehensive way. This research provides an empirical baseline study of existing morphologies, their similarities and differences across the globe. To do so, we conceptually approach urban poverty as places which provide relatively cheap living spaces serving as possible access to the city, to its society and to its functions \textendash{} so called Arrival Cities. Based on a systematic literature survey we select a sample of 44 Arrival Cities across the globe. Using very high resolution optical satellite data in combination with street view images and field work we derive level of detail-1 3D-building models for all study areas. We measure the spatial structure of these settlements by the spatial pattern (by three features \textendash{} building density, building orientation and heterogeneity of the pattern) and the morphology of individual buildings (by two features \textendash{} building size and height). We develop a morphologic settlement type index based on all five features allowing categorization of Arrival Cities. We find a large morphologic variety for built environments of the urban poor, from slum and slum-like structures to formal and planned structures. This variability is found on all continents, within countries and even within a single city. At the same time detected categories (such as slums) are found to have very similar physical features across the globe.},

We identified fifteen commonly used indices of area-level socioeconomic deprivation. There were notable differences in the characteristics of each index, particularly in how they define socioeconomic deprivation based on input-variable domains, the geography over which they are applied, and their output measures. These characteristics can help guide future index selection and application in clinical care, research, and policy decisions.}

  abstract = {Inundation disasters, caused by sudden water level rise or rapid flow, occur frequently in various parts of the world. Such catastrophes strike not only in thinly populated flood plains or farmland but also in highly populated villages or urban areas. Inundation of the populated areas causes severe damage to the economy, injury, and loss of life; therefore, a proper management scheme for the disaster has to be developed. To predict and manage such adversity, an understanding of the dynamic processes of inundation flow is necessary because risk estimation is performed based on inundation flow information. In this study, we developed a comprehensive method to conduct detailed inundation flow simulations for a populated area with quite complex topographical features using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Detailed geospatial information including the location and shape of each building was extracted from the LiDAR data and used for the grid generation. The developed approach can distinguish buildings from vegetation and treat them differently in the flow model. With this method, a fine unstructured grid can be generated representing the complicated urban land features precisely without exhausting labour for data preparation. The accuracy of the generated grid with different grid spacing and grid type is discussed and the optimal range of grid spacing for direct representation of urban topography is investigated. The developed method is applied to the estimation of inundation flows, which occurred in the basin of the Shin-minato River. A detailed inundation flow structure is represented by the flow model, and the flow characteristics with respect to topographic features are discussed.

However, in the light of increasing mixedmethods research, as well as research using geocodes, it is necessary to train students in the field of ethics. Experiential learning is an approach to teaching that is potentially suitable for teaching ethics. The aim of this article is to discuss how the experiential learning process in a course on Ethics \& GPS-tracking contributed to the ethical awareness of third-year undergraduate geography students. We conducted a qualitative study in which we held four focus group discussions with two cohorts of students (2016 and 2017). We explored the students' views on the learning environment in relation to ethics in GPS-based and mixed-methods research. Our findings show how an informal learning environment and collaborative learning in a small group contributed to deep understanding of research ethics. These aspects of the learning environment are tied to an ethical framework that consists of three dimensions: (1) the ethics of collaborative research between staff and students; (2) the ethics of privacy raised by the geo-technology adopted in this research case study; and (3) the ethics of the research process with respect to informed consent and data storage.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the progress in remote sensing of soil moisture, with focus on technique approaches for soil moisture estimation from optical, thermal, passive microwave, and active microwave measurements. The physical principles and the status of current retrieval methods are summarized. Limitations existing in current soil moisture estimation algorithms and key issues that have to be addressed in the near future are also discussed.},

Traditional approaches have used demographics and geographical influences to estimate crime rates in a region. With the fast development of positioning technology and prevalence of mobile devices, a large amount of modern urban data have been collected and such big data can provide new perspectives for understanding crime. In this paper, we used large-scale Point-Of-Interest data and taxi flow data in the city of Chicago, IL in the USA. We observed significantly improved performance in crime rate inference compared to using traditional features. Such an improvement is consistent over multiple years. We also show that these new features are significant in the feature importance analysis.},

We therefore examined spatiotemporal patterns of population migration across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) using migration big data from Tencent for the period between 2015 and 2019. We initially used decomposition and breakpoint detection methods to examine time-series migration data and to identify the two seasons with the strongest and weakest population migration levels, between June 18th and August 18th and between October 8th and February 15th, respectively. Population migration within the former period was 2.03 times that seen in the latter. We then used a variety of network analysis methods to examine population flow directions as well as the importance of each individual city in migration. The two capital cities on the QTP, Lhasa and Xining, form centers for population migration and are also transfer hubs through which migrants from other cities off the plateau enter and leave this region. Data show that these two cities contribute more than 35\% of total population migration. The majority of migrants tend to move within the province, particularly during the weakest migration season. We also utilized interactive relationship force and radiation models to examine the interaction strength and the radiating energy of each individual city. Results show that Lhasa and Xining exhibit the strongest interactions with other cities and have the largest radiating energies. Indeed, the radiating energy of the QTP cities correlates with their gross domestic product (GDP) (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.754 in the weakest migration season, WMS versus 0.737 in the strongest migration season, SMS), while changes in radiating energy correlate with the tourism-related revenue (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.685). These outcomes suggest that level of economic development and level of tourism are the two most important factors driving the QTP population migration. The results of this analysis provide critical clarification guidance regarding huge QTP development differences.},

A retrospective study examined one year of hospital admissions for asthma in the West Midlands region of England (n = 10,044), and in one of the region's wealthier districts, Worcester (n = 251). Age standardized admission ratios (SARs) for asthma, and the routes of hospital admission, were compared with the Towns- end Deprivation Index for the place of residence. Asthma SAR was strongly associated with deprivation as measured by the Towns end Index for the district of residence (Spearman rank correlation coefficient rho = 0.65; p = 0.004). Asthma admission rates for all age groups, except those aged over 65 yrs, were higher in poorer districts. A significantly greater proportion of emergency admissions in poorer districts came via Accident and Emergency departments, rather than general practitioner referrals (rho = 0.76; p {$<$} 0.001). Within Worcester District, SAR was associated with Townsend Index for the ward of residence (rho = 0.39; p {$<$} 0.001). This remained significant after excluding repeat admissions (rho = 0.45; p {$<$} 0.001). We conclude that asthma admissions are strongly associated with deprivation in the community. Differences in the health care received during acute exacerbations by asthma patients from different economic backgrounds is likely to be an important factor in this relationship.},

They have shifted their emphasis from compromised use values (embodied in the paternalistic notion of ``blight'') to diminished exchange values (embodied in the notion of ``obsolescence'').

They are characterized mostly by extremely high building densities and small building sizes, irregular arrangement of buildings and street network and are often located at exposed sites . Based on these characteristics, we deploy satellite images for a systematic mapping of morphological slum areas in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil based solely on physical characteristics and analyse the mapping result with the official census data. Outcomes show first that morphological slums are a semantic and spatial sub-group of all slum areas contained by the Brazilian census and that remote sensing-based mapping yields accuracies of almost 94\%. Second, analysis of census-based income data proofs that while almost 45\% of all mapped slum blocks are characterized by incomes below the poverty line, as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), this holds true for only about 6\% of the formal urban neighbourhoods.},

In the past thirty years, as one of spatial data sources, remote sensing datasets, which contain more information of earth surface as compared with usual urban maps, have been used in urban planning and management in China. With the development of remote sensing technology such as the high spatial resolution sensors, 3D laser scanning, data mining and advanced image processing technology, remote sensing can be widely used in the whole range of urban planning processes. In this paper, we firstly make a review of the urban remote sensing applications in urban study and planning by giving examples. Then we identify remote sensing applications in different urban planning stages including master planning, district planning, detailed planning and planning implementation as well as in urban studies. We also analyze the bottlenecks of the remote sensing applications in urban planning and management in China at the end.},

The major findings are as follows. From 2008 to 2020, the distribution of the school-age migrant population exhibited obvious spatial imbalance characteristics both in terms of the number and proportion of school-age migrants. Specifically, the school-age migrant population was concentrated in the municipal districts of large and medium-sized cities and continued to increase over time in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities. Over the past 12 years, the distribution of the school-age migrant population in Liaoning Province exhibited significant spatial autocorrelation. From the number of school-age migrants, the cold and hot spot area expanded. Conversely, from the proportion of school-age migrants, the cold and hot spot area decreased gradually, whereas the cold spot area became more diffuse. Regarding the driving factors, the quantity and quality of teaching staff, the quality of teaching equipment and conditions, and the quality of the education environment played a role in promoting or restraining the differentiation of the school-age migrant population in Liaoning Province. Moreover, the degree of influence of the driving factors exhibited substantial spatial differences.},

  abstract = {Distribution of land cover has a profound impact on the climate and environment; mapping the land cover patterns from global, regional to local scales are important for scientists and authorities to yield better monitoring of the changing world. Satellite remote sensing has been demonstrated as an efficient tool to monitor the land cover patterns for a large spatial extent. Nevertheless, the demand on land cover maps at a finer scale (especially in urban areas) has been raised with evidence by numerous biophysical and socio-economic studies. This paper reviews the small-footprint LiDAR sensor \textemdash{} one of the latest high resolution airborne remote sensing technologies, and its application on urban land cover classification. While most of the early researches focus on the analysis of geometric components of 3D LiDAR data point clouds, there has been an increasing interest in investigating the use of intensity data, waveform data and multi-sensor data to facilitate land cover classification and object recognition in urban environment. In this paper, the advancement of airborne LiDAR technology, including data configuration, feature spaces, classification techniques, and radiometric calibration/correction is reviewed and discussed. The review mainly focuses on the LiDAR studies conducted during the last decade with an emphasis on identification of the approach, analysis of pros and cons, investigating the overall accuracy of the technology, and how the classification results can serve as an input for different urban environmental analyses. Finally, several promising directions for future LiDAR research are highlighted, in hope that it will pave the way for the applications of urban environmental modeling and assessment at a finer scale and a greater extent.},

Using suites of datasets relating to population, house prices, and built environment development, the nature of gentrification's mutations and its spatial patterns are extracted through a multi-stage data dimensionality reduction and classification methodology. Machine learning is subsequently adopted to model gentrification's observed trends and predict its future frontiers with interactive visualisation methods offering new insights into gentrification's projected dynamics and geographies.},

To verify and refine the reconstructed ragged model, we present a primitive-based model refinement approach that requires minor user assistance. Given the limited user input, the system automatically segments the building boundary, does the model refinement, and assembles the complete building model. By adapting a set of appropriate geometric primitives and fitting strategies, the system can model a range of complex buildings with irregular shapes. We demonstrate this system's ability to model a variety of complex buildings rapidly and accurately from LiDAR data of the entire USC campus.},

In particular, a Landsat ETM+ image was utilized to derive environmental characteristics, including the fractions of vegetation, impervious surface, and soil, with a linear spectral mixture analysis approach. These environmental characteristics, together with house structural attributes, were integrated to house value models. Two modeling techniques, a global OLSregression and a regression tree approach, were employed to build the relationship between house values and house structural and environmental characteristics. Analysis of results indicates that environmental characteristics generated from remote sensing technologies have strong influences on house values, and the addition of them improves house value modeling performance significantly. Moreover, the regression tree model proves as a better alternative to the OLS regression models in terms of predicting accuracy.In particular, based on the testing dataset, the mean average error (MAE) and relative error (RE) dropped from 0.202 and 0.434 for the OLS model to 0.134 and 0.280 for the regression tree model, while the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed values increased from 0.903 to0.960. Further, as a nonparametric and local model, the regression tree method alleviates the problems with the OLS techniques and provides a means in delineating urban housing submarkets.},

This paper demonstrates that Building Coverage Ratio (BCR), Floor Area Ratio (FAR), and other building density indicators can be numerically and automatically derived from high-resolution airborne LiDAR data. An object-based method is proposed to process the LiDAR data for the building density information. The method consists of a sequence of numerical operations: generating the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM), extracting building objects, deriving object attributes, associating objects with the corresponding land lots, and computing building density indicators at land lot and urban district scales. The algorithms for these operations have been implemented as an ArcGIS extension module. The object-based method is applied to the processing of airborne LiDAR data over downtown Houston. Various attributes have been derived to quantify the building density, urban physical structure, and landscape morphological characteristics of the downtown area at three different spatial scales.},

There is an apparent correlation between LST and NDVI from the visual interpretation of LST and NDVI contrasts. Mean LST and NDVI values associated with different land-use types are significantly different. Multiple comparisons of mean LST and NDVI values associated with pairings of each land-use type are also shown to be significantly different. The result of a regressive analysis shows an inverse correlation relationship between LST and NDVI within all land-use polygons, the same to each land-use type, but correlation coefficients associated with land-use types are different. An analysis on the relationship between LST, NDVI and Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) shows a positive correlation between LST and SHDI and a negative correlation between NDVI and SHDI. According to the above results, LST, SHDI and NDVI can be considered to be three basic indices to study the urban ecological environment and to contribute to further validation of the applicability of relatively low cost, moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery in evaluating environmental impacts of urban land function zoning, then to examine the impact of urban land-use on the urban environment in Shanghai City. This provides an effective tool in evaluating the environmental influences of zoning in urban ecosystems with remote sensing and geographical information systems.},

By analyzing three village cases in Zhuhai, we found that growth coalition theory overemphasized the increasing alliance between political and business elites at the expense of other actors such as villagers and rural collectives. The Shanchang case indicated the close coalition between the developer and the villagers to appeal jointly for additional rights from the local government. The local government made concessions about acknowledging illegal property rights and increasing allowable floor space to facilitate the smooth implementation of demolition. By contrast, the Lixi and Fuxi case showed that the local government formed a coalition with the rural collective in the demolition and compensation stage and formed an alliance with the developer in the construction stage. The case indicated that the government pursued the long-term goal of improving urban livability and enhancing industrial development apart from advocating property-led growth. This paper disclosed the diversity and complexity of the growth coalition, which could enrich the existing framework.},

  abstract = {The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78\% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.},

But it is not at all clear what these arrangements will mean for cities that have spent the past decade building an ?innovation complex? around physical density, digital technology and real estate development. On the one hand, many parts of the tech ecosystem that relied on face-to-face interaction ? such as coworking spaces, hackathons and venture capitalists? mentoring of start-up founders ? have already moved online. On the other hand, cutting tech ecosystems loose from place-based offices, labour markets and institutional networks puts cities? economic future at risk. This could drastically weaken the value of the city?s fixed capital of buildings and land, its social capital of institutional networks and communities, and its human capital of workers with tech skills.

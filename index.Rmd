## Overview of HAP Workflow
**Pre-Heat Season (Jan-Mar)**
- AMC Nodal Officer coordinates inter-agency communications
- Health Department and Medical Professionals educate and prepare heat-related procedures
- 108 Emergency Service builds public awareness and **identifies vulnerable areas**
**Heat Season** (March-July)
- AMC Nodal Officer activates heat alerts when extreme heat events are forecasted + activates cooling centres and night shelters
- Community groups check on each other
**Post-Heat Season (July-Sept)**
- AMC Nodal Officer conducts evaluation and identifies key areas for improvement.

## Slums Detection

### Objective

identify the slums boundary

### Data

* EO data
  * high resolution imagery: from the [QuickBird satellite](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/quickbird-2)
> The QuickBird sensor provides a geometric resolution of 0.60 m in panchromatic mode and therefore basically allows for a delineation of the objects in slums `r Citep(myBib,"taubenbock2014")`.
  * Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ 
  *	TerraSAR-X data, available [here](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/terrasar-x-and-tandem-x#data-section)

* Spatial data
  *	Street network: from the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/54.910/-3.432)

## Integrating them (Will edit more after Young and Yifei)
**Slum detection**
The slum detection process can be conducted once a year, ideally before the hot season. This is inline with the general workflow for the Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan, where they have an action plan for the Pre-Heat Season (January- March) where they prepare for the heat season.

To give time for the geospatial team to generate estimates of slums, the process should begin ideally after the Post-Heat Season, but also with consideration to when satellite imagery might be least affected by cloud cover. Cloud cover is lowest in January, which is when the data collection process should start. Ideally the slum detection process should finish before March.

**Temperature Monitoring**
Temperature monitoring can be done via remote sensors, and we can incorporate it into the Nodal Officer’s workflow of monitoring and predicting extreme heat events.

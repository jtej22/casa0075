  abstract = {The survey-based slum mapping (SBSM) program conducted by the Indonesian government to reach the national target of ``cities without slums'' by 2019 shows mapping inconsistencies due to several reasons, e.g., the dependency on the surveyor's experiences and the complexity of the slum indicators set. By relying on such inconsistent maps, it will be difficult to monitor the national slum upgrading program's progress. Remote sensing imagery combined with machine learning algorithms could support the reduction of these inconsistencies. This study evaluates the performance of two machine learning algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), for slum mapping in support of the slum mapping campaign in Bandung, Indonesia. Recognizing the complexity in differentiating slum and formal areas in Indonesia, the study used a combination of spectral, contextual, and morphological features. In addition, sequential feature selection (SFS) combined with the Hilbert\textendash Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) was used to select significant features for classifying slums. Overall, the highest accuracy (88.5\%) was achieved by the SVM with SFS using contextual, morphological, and spectral features, which is higher than the estimated accuracy of the SBSM. To evaluate the potential of machine learning-based slum mapping (MLBSM) in support of slum upgrading programs, interviews were conducted with several local and national stakeholders. Results show that local acceptance for a remote sensing-based slum mapping approach varies among stakeholder groups. Therefore, a locally adapted framework is required to combine ground surveys with robust and consistent machine learning methods, for being able to deal with big data, and to allow the rapid extraction of consistent information on the dynamics of slums at a large scale.},

  abstract = {The term ``slum'' is difficult to define, but if we see one, we know it. Definitions for slums are qualitative such as ``areas of people lacking, for example, durable housing or easy access to safe water''. This study aims at identifying characteristic physical features of the built environment that allows defining slum areas based on quantitative and measurable parameters. In general, spatial data on slums are generalized, outdated, or even nonexistent. The bird's eye view of remotely sensed data is capable to provide an independent, area-wide spatial overview, to capture the complex morphological pattern and at the same time capture the large-scale individual objects typical for slums. Using high-resolution optical satellite data, parameters such as building density, building heights, and sizes are used to differentiate between slums and formal settlements. From it, the physical features are used to analyze structural homogeneity and heterogeneities within and across slums and to suggest characteristic physical features for spatial slum delineation at three study sites in Mumbai, India.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, massive urbanization processes lead to the emergence of large slum areas making them home to about a seventh of the global population. Although the variety of morphological characteristics varies significantly within as well as across cities, common determinants exist. Informal, or unplanned settlements in particular, do show similar morphologies over the world. They are characterized mostly by extremely high building densities and small building sizes, irregular arrangement of buildings and street network and are often located at exposed sites . Based on these characteristics, we deploy satellite images for a systematic mapping of morphological slum areas in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil based solely on physical characteristics and analyse the mapping result with the official census data. Outcomes show first that morphological slums are a semantic and spatial sub-group of all slum areas contained by the Brazilian census and that remote sensing-based mapping yields accuracies of almost 94\%. Second, analysis of census-based income data proofs that while almost 45\% of all mapped slum blocks are characterized by incomes below the poverty line, as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), this holds true for only about 6\% of the formal urban neighbourhoods.},

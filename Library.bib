  abstract   = {The survey-based slum mapping (SBSM) program conducted by the Indonesian government to reach the national target of ``cities without slums'' by 2019 shows mapping inconsistencies due to several reasons, e.g., the dependency on the surveyor's experiences and the complexity of the slum indicators set. By relying on such inconsistent maps, it will be difficult to monitor the national slum upgrading program's progress. Remote sensing imagery combined with machine learning algorithms could support the reduction of these inconsistencies. This study evaluates the performance of two machine learning algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), for slum mapping in support of the slum mapping campaign in Bandung, Indonesia. Recognizing the complexity in differentiating slum and formal areas in Indonesia, the study used a combination of spectral, contextual, and morphological features. In addition, sequential feature selection (SFS) combined with the Hilbert\textendash Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) was used to select significant features for classifying slums. Overall, the highest accuracy (88.5\%) was achieved by the SVM with SFS using contextual, morphological, and spectral features, which is higher than the estimated accuracy of the SBSM. To evaluate the potential of machine learning-based slum mapping (MLBSM) in support of slum upgrading programs, interviews were conducted with several local and national stakeholders. Results show that local acceptance for a remote sensing-based slum mapping approach varies among stakeholder groups. Therefore, a locally adapted framework is required to combine ground surveys with robust and consistent machine learning methods, for being able to deal with big data, and to allow the rapid extraction of consistent information on the dynamics of slums at a large scale.},

Definitions for slums are qualitative such as ``areas of people lacking, for example, durable housing or easy access to safe water''. This study aims at identifying characteristic physical features of the built environment that allows defining slum areas based on quantitative and measurable parameters. In general, spatial data on slums are generalized, outdated, or even nonexistent. The bird's eye view of remotely sensed data is capable to provide an independent, area-wide spatial overview, to capture the complex morphological pattern and at the same time capture the large-scale individual objects typical for slums. Using high-resolution optical satellite data, parameters such as building density, building heights, and sizes are used to differentiate between slums and formal settlements. From it, the physical features are used to analyze structural homogeneity and heterogeneities within and across slums and to suggest characteristic physical features for spatial slum delineation at three study sites in Mumbai, India.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, massive urbanization processes lead to the emergence of large slum areas making them home to about a seventh of the global population. Although the variety of morphological characteristics varies significantly within as well as across cities, common determinants exist. Informal, or unplanned settlements in particular, do show similar morphologies over the world. They are characterized mostly by extremely high building densities and small building sizes, irregular arrangement of buildings and street network and are often located at exposed sites . Based on these characteristics, we deploy satellite images for a systematic mapping of morphological slum areas in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil based solely on physical characteristics and analyse the mapping result with the official census data. Outcomes show first that morphological slums are a semantic and spatial sub-group of all slum areas contained by the Brazilian census and that remote sensing-based mapping yields accuracies of almost 94\%. Second, analysis of census-based income data proofs that while almost 45\% of all mapped slum blocks are characterized by incomes below the poverty line, as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), this holds true for only about 6\% of the formal urban neighbourhoods.},

  abstract     = {Many efficient forecasting models have been found to fail or show low skill due to the changes in the predictor–predictand relationship with the changes in global climate. An attempt has been taken to develop a climate change resilient heatwave prediction model using machine learning (ML) algorithms known as Support Vector Machines (SVM), random forest and artificial neural network. The National Centres for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data of ocean-atmospheric variables were used as the predictors of ML models for forecasting the number of heatwave days (HWDs) in the summer of Pakistan. An SVM based recursive feature elimination method was used to select the skilful predictors. The ML models were developed by considering a moving window of 29~years with a time step of 5~years to incorporate the changes in the relation of HWDs with its predictors due to climate change. The result showed changes in the relationship of HWDs with all the ocean-atmospheric variables considered in this study as probable predictors, which indicates the necessity of forward-rolling approach proposed in this study for the development of climate change resilient forecasting model. The relative performance of ML showed the higher capability of SVM to predict HWDs with an \%NRMSE of 36, R2 of 0.87, md score of 0.76 and an rSD of 0.88 during the validation period. The result revealed the potential of SVM model to be used for reliable forecasting of heatwaves in the context of climate change.},

  abstract     = {The health impacts of heat waves are an emerging environmental health concern. This is especially so for large cities where there is a concentration of people and because of the urban heat island effect. Temperatures within cities can reach stressful levels during extreme temperature events. To better manage heat related health risks, information is required on the intra-urban variability of vulnerability to heat wave events. Accordingly a heat vulnerability index (HVI) is developed and presented for Greater London in the United Kingdom. The approach to HVI development adopted is an inductive one whereby nine proxy measures of heat risk are extracted from the 2001 London census for 4765 census districts and subject to principal components analysis. Scores for the emergent principal components are weighted according to the variance they explain and summed to form the HVI. Although mapping of the HVI shows what appears to be a heterogeneous heat “risk-scape” statistical testing reveals significant spatial clustering of areas of high heat vulnerability in central and east London which also co-occur with areas of potentially high heat exposure. Drivers of the spatial pattern of heat vulnerability are discussed as are the implications of study results for heat risk management in large cities.},

  abstract     = {Introduction In the recent past, spells of extreme heat associated with appreciable mortality have been documented in developed countries, including North America and Europe. However, far fewer research reports are available from developing countries or specific cities in South Asia. In May 2010, Ahmedabad, India, faced a heat wave where the temperatures reached a high of 46.8°C with an apparent increase in mortality. The purpose of this study is to characterize the heat wave impact and assess the associated excess mortality. Methods We conducted an analysis of all-cause mortality associated with a May 2010 heat wave in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, to determine whether extreme heat leads to excess mortality. Counts of all-cause deaths from May 1–31, 2010 were compared with the mean of counts from temporally matched periods in May 2009 and 2011 to calculate excess mortality. Other analyses included a 7-day moving average, mortality rate ratio analysis, and relationship between daily maximum temperature and daily all-cause death counts over the entire year of 2010, using month-wise correlations. Results The May 2010 heat wave was associated with significant excess all-cause mortality. 4,462 all-cause deaths occurred, comprising an excess of 1,344 all-cause deaths, an estimated 43.1\% increase when compared to the reference period (3,118 deaths). In monthly pair-wise comparisons for 2010, we found high correlations between mortality and daily maximum temperature during the locally hottest “summer” months of April (r = 0.69, p{$<$}0.001), May (r = 0.77, p{$<$}0.001), and June (r = 0.39, p{$<$}0.05). During a period of more intense heat (May 19–25, 2010), mortality rate ratios were 1.76 [95\% CI 1.67–1.83, p{$<$}0.001] and 2.12 [95\% CI 2.03–2.21] applying reference periods (May 12–18, 2010) from various years. Conclusion The May 2010 heat wave in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India had a substantial effect on all-cause excess mortality, even in this city where hot temperatures prevail through much of April-June.},

Principal component analysis and line detection algorithms were applied alternatively to obtain a high resolution binary representation of the city of Hyderabad, India and used to calculate lacunarity values over a 60~\texttimes ~60~m grid. A number of ground truthing areas were used to classify the resulting datasets and to identify lacunarity ranges which are typical for settlement types that combine high density housing and small dwelling size \textendash{} features characteristic for urban slums in India. It was discovered that the line detection algorithm is advantageous over principal component analysis in providing suitable binary datasets for lacunarity analysis as it is less sensitive to spectral variability within mosaicked imagery. The resulting slum location map constitutes an efficient tool in identifying particularly overcrowded areas of the city and can be used as a reliable source in vulnerability and resilience assessments at a later stage. The proposed methodology allows for rapid analysis and comparison of multi-temporal data and can be applied on many developing urban agglomerations around the world.},
